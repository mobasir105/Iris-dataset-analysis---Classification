# Iris-dataset-analysis---Classification
Iris dataset analysis - Classification
This Jupyter notebook performs an analysis and classification of the Iris dataset using Python. Key steps include:

- Importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
- Loading and displaying the dataset.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms and scatter plots.
- Checking for null values.
- Encoding categorical labels using `LabelEncoder`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a machine learning model for classification.
